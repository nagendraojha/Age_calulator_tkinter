# Age_calulator_tkinter
This Python code creates a simple Age Calculator app using the tkinter library, which is used for building graphical user interfaces. When the program runs, it opens a small window where users can enter their name, year, month, and day of birth. After entering the details, users can click the "Calculate age" button. Once clicked, the app uses the datetime module to get the current date and calculates the user's age by subtracting the birth year from the current year. It also adjusts the result if the user's birthday hasn’t occurred yet in the current year. The calculated age is then displayed in the window with a message like “John's age is 25.” The layout of the app is managed using a grid system, and it remains open and responsive using root.mainloop() which keeps the GUI running in an infinite loop.
